# Tic Tac Toe game on terminal
Small project made from scratch within 2 or so hours to show off my coding skills to brother :)
Has a multi-player component to it only currently.
Uses basic concepts about classes, objects, and data structures like arrays, arraylists, to implement a 2-D String Array of numbers.
# To play:
Enter the number of the square you want to play at and press enter.
Alternates between player 1 and 2
# Future plans with Project
Wish to implement an engine type smart algorithm to auto-play.
Include a good user interface with buttons, and possible animations through Android Studio API
